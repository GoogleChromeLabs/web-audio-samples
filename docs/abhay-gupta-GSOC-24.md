# Abhay Gupta - Google Summer of Code 2024

## Brief

**Contributor**: Abhay Gupta ([@professorabhay](https://github.com/professorabhay)) <br>
**Mentors**: Hongchan Choi ([@hoch](https://github.com/hoch)),
Michael Wilson ([@mjwilson-google](https://github.com/mjwilson-google)) <br>
**Organization**: Chromium - Web Audio Team <br>
**Description** - This project is about enhancing the Audioworklet by improving the implementation of the RingBuffer and creating a live test suite for Audioworklet.

## What Was Accomplished

In this project, I undertook a comprehensive restructuring of the HeapAudioBuffer and FreeQueue implementations to enhance their efficiency and optimize performance. This involved several key tasks:

### Project Structure Enhancement

I established a new `lib` directory within the `src` folder, specifically dedicated to audio worklet-related components. Within this directory, I created a `free-queue` subdirectory to house all relevant files.

### Implementation of FreeQueue and HeapAudioBuffer

I introduced two critical files: `free-queue.js` and `free-queue-sab.js`.

- **`free-queue.js`**: This file contains the optimized implementation of the existing FreeQueue class.
- **`free-queue-sab.js`**: This file implements the HeapAudioBuffer class, leveraging a more efficient design.

Additionally, I authored a README document to assist developers in understanding and utilizing these components effectively.

### Test Suite Development

To ensure the reliability and performance of the new implementations, I created comprehensive test suites using Chai and Mocha. These test cases cover various scenarios, including performance benchmarking, input/output validation, and more.

The test cases are organized within a `test` folder, containing the following files:

- **`free-queue.test.js`** and **`free-queue-sab.test.js`**: JavaScript files containing the test cases.
- **`free-queue.test.html`** and **`free-queue-sab.test.html`**: HTML files that enable the tests to be executed directly from a browser environment.

This restructuring not only improved the performance and maintainability of the codebase but also provided a robust testing framework that ensured the components function correctly across various scenarios.

## Merged PRs

- [**Consolidated the existing RingBuffer Implementation**](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/pull/369):
    - Created a new `lib/free-queue/` directory under `src/`.
    - Added `free-queue.js` and `free-queue-sab.js` files.
    - Added the code.
    - Updated the imports/usage with new classes.
- [**FreeQueueSAB: automated test coverage**](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/pull/374):
  - Folder Structure Setup and added the files for writing the tests: `free-queue-sab.test.js` and `free-queue-sab.test.html`.
  - Added multiple test cases to cover all the bottleneck areas.
- [**FreeQueue: automated test coverage**](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/pull/388):
  - Folder Structure Setup and added the files for writing the tests: `free-queue.test.js` and `free-queue.test.html`.
  - Added multiple test cases to cover all the bottleneck areas.
- [**Readme Documentation**](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/pull/383):
  - Added the documentation.
- [**More Test Cases**](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/pull/391):
  - Added more test cases in `free-queue-sab` for better coverage.

## Whatâ€™s Left to Do

While significant progress has been made, a few key tasks remain to complete the project fully:

### NPM Package Creation and Publishing

The next step involves packaging the FreeQueue and HeapAudioBuffer implementations into an npm package. This will make it easier for other developers to integrate and use these optimized components directly in their projects.

### Documentation of Performance Comparison

We need to document the results of the performance comparison between the FreeQueue class and an external project. This documentation will provide valuable insights into the efficiency gains and help in understanding the improvements over existing solutions.

## Acknowledgment

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my mentors, Michael Wilson, and Hongchan Choi, for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. Working with them has been an incredibly rewarding experience, and their expertise and encouragement played a crucial role in the success of this project.

Their insights not only helped me navigate challenges but also inspired me to push the boundaries of my knowledge and skills. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to learn from such accomplished professionals and for the chance to contribute to this meaningful project.

Thank you for your unwavering support and for making this journey a memorable one.
