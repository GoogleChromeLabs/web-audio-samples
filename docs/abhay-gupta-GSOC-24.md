# Abhay Gupta - Google Summer of Code 2024

**Organization**: Chromium - Web Audio Team <br>
**Description** - This project is about enhancing the Audioworklet by improving the implementation of the RingBuffer and creating a live test suite for Audioworklet.

## What Was Accomplished

In this project, I undertook a comprehensive restructuring of the HeapAudioBuffer and FreeQueue implementations to enhance their efficiency and optimize performance. This involved several key tasks:

### Project Structure Enhancement

I established a new `lib` directory within the `src` folder, specifically dedicated to audio worklet-related components. Within this directory, I created a `free-queue` subdirectory to house all relevant files.

### Implementation of FreeQueue and HeapAudioBuffer

I introduced two critical files: `free-queue.js` and `free-queue-sab.js`.

- **`free-queue.js`**: This file contains the optimized implementation of the existing FreeQueue class.
- **`free-queue-sab.js`**: This file implements the HeapAudioBuffer class, leveraging a more efficient design.

Additionally, I authored a README document to assist developers in understanding and utilizing these components effectively.

### Test Suite Development

To ensure the reliability and performance of the new implementations, I created comprehensive test suites using Chai and Mocha. These test cases cover various scenarios, including performance benchmarking, input/output validation, and more.

The test cases are organized within a `test` folder, containing the following files:

- **`free-queue.test.js`** and **`free-queue-sab.test.js`**: JavaScript files containing the test cases.
- **`free-queue.test.html`** and **`free-queue-sab.test.html`**: HTML files that enable the tests to be executed directly from a browser environment.

### Documentation of Performance Comparison

We also documented the results of the performance comparison between the `FreeQueueSAB` class and an external project. This documentation will provide valuable insights into the efficiency gains and help understand the improvements over existing solutions.

### NPM Package Creation and Publishing Guide

The next step involves packaging the `FreeQueue` and `FreeQueueSAB` implementations into an npm package. This will make it easier for other developers to integrate and use these optimized components directly in their projects. I created the guide for making the package and publishing it to the npm website for the project maintainers, as they can do it from their end.

This restructuring not only improved the performance and maintainability of the codebase but also provided a robust testing framework that ensured the components function correctly across various scenarios.

## Merged PRs
