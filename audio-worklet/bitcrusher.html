  This code illustrates a web audio bitcrusher implementation, a musical audio 
  effect. The bitcrusher class defined in bitcrusher.js binds the script 
  processor node's onaudioprocess method to a bitcrush function, which reduces 
  the precision of individual samples and simulates a sample rate reduction by a
  specified factor. These parameters can be modified as the sound source is 
  running concurrently.

    <h1>Bitcrusher: a lo-fi audio effect</h1>
    <p>
      Hit play to start a song and listen to the distortive effect of
      modifying the bit depth and sample rate reduction parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bit depth slider controls the number of bits used to represent
      a given sample. The sample rate reduction slider affects the number
      of distinct samples in the signal. Increasing this value simulates
      sample rate reduction by making intervals of consecutive samples equal.
